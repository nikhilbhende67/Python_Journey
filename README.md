## 1. Fundamentals of Python

1. **String Concatenation and Formatting**:
   - How to print given strings in a specified format using separators and end parameters in the `print` function.
   - Different methods for string concatenation in Python, including using the `+` operator, the `round()` method, and the `format()` function.
2. **Conversion from Celsius to Fahrenheit**:
   - Writing a program to convert temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit using the formula `F = C \times \frac{9}{5} + 32`.
3. **Swapping Two Numbers**:
   - A method to swap two numbers without using temporary variables or special Python syntax.

4. **Euclidean Distance Calculation**:
   - Writing a program to calculate the Euclidean distance between two points.

5. **Simple Interest Calculation**:
   - A program to calculate simple interest given the principal amount, rate of interest, and time period .

6. **Determining the Number of Dogs and Chickens**:
   - A program that calculates the number of dogs and chickens based on the total number of heads and legs .

7. **Sum of Squares of First N Natural Numbers**:
   - Writing a program to find the sum of squares of the first `n` natural numbers .

8. **Finding the Nth Term of an Arithmetic Series**:
   - A program to find the `n`th term of an arithmetic series given the first two terms .

9. **Sum of Two Fractions**:
   - Writing a program to find the sum of two given fractions .

10. **Calculating the Number of Glasses of Milk from a Milk Tank**:
    - A program to calculate how many glasses of milk can be obtained from a milk tank given the dimensions of the tank and the glass .

These topics cover a range of fundamental programming concepts in Python, including string manipulation, mathematical calculations, and logical problem-solving.
